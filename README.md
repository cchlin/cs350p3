## Insertion sort & merge sort compare run
This is a small program implemented in C++ with insertion sort
and merge sort. It is used to compare the time complexity of
two sorting algorithm to see how each sorting algorithm run
with different inputs. Such as random arrays, almost sorted
arrays, and sorted arrays.
## How to use
Enter the size of array into command line argument and the program
will take one array to run in these two sorting alrothm and return
their execution time.
